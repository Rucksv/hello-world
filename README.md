# hello-world
you gotta start at something

this is my first project in github. im still new at programming, at the moment kinda encapsulated in python.
Although i definitly have some projects in mind that i hope i will be able to accompilish when the time comes.
Im still trying out a lot of possibilty of my creations. my biggest dream is creating a nice compact game, which is completly selfmade.
Tho that will take some time. Well im looking forward to it :D.

Regards,

Rob
